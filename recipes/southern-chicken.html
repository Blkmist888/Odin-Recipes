<h2> Description</h2>
<p>This is a dish made of flavorful chicken, using multiple different spices. It is often cooked throughout the world. You will need multiple ingredients.</p>
<h3> Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>10 boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
<li>2 cups low-fat buttermilk</li>
<li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
<li>2 tablespoons kosher salt, divided</li>
<li>4 teaspoons black pepper, divided</li>
<li>4 cups all-purpose flour, for dredging</li>
<li>Canola or peanut oil, for frying</li>
</ul>
<h4> Steps</h4>
<ol>

    <li>Add the chicken thighs to a mixing bowl. Add the buttermilk, paprika, cayenne, 1 tablespoon of the salt, and 2 teaspoons of the black pepper. Mix and make sure the chicken is covered with the buttermilk mixture. Refrigerate for 2 hours to marinate.</li>

<br>

<li>Add the flour and remaining 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons black pepper to a baking dish. Using tongs, remove the chicken 2 to 3 pieces at a time and coat well in the seasoned flour. Be sure to press the flour into the meat and cover completely. Shake off excess and reserve on a baking sheet.</li>

<br>

<li>When all the pieces of chicken are dredged in the flour, add about an inch of oil to a heavy, deep frying pan. Over a medium-high flame, heat the oil to 375 F.</li>

<br>

<li>Test the oil to make sure it's hot. Add the chicken, being careful not to overcrowd the pan, and cook for 7 to 8 minutes per side, or until the outside is browned and the meat is cooked through. The thickest part of the meat should register at least 165 F on a meat thermometer.</li>

<br>

<li>Serve immediately or hold in a warm oven if frying in batches.</li>
