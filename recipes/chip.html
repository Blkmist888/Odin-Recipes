<h2>Description</h2>

<h3> Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>7 tablespoons (55 grams) all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li>7 tablespoons (55 grams) cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
  <li>Sea salt, to taste</li>
   <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li> 
   <li> 1/3 cup dark beer, cold</li> 
   <li> 1/3 cup sparkling water, cold</li>
</ul> <!-- END OF INGREDIENTS FOR FISH AND CHIPS-->
<h4> Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Group up your indgredients</li>
<br>
<li>Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the remaining flour with the cornstarch and baking powder. Season lightly with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
<br>
<li>Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the sparkling water to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
<br>
<li>Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide chips. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under cold running water.</li>
<br>
<li>Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
<br>
<li>Drain carefully through a colander, then dry with paper towels. Keep in the fridge covered with paper towels until needed.</li>
<br>
<li>Meanwhile, lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season lightly with a little sea salt.</li>
<br>
<li>Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep-fat fryer or large, deep saucepan. Cook the chips a few handfuls at a time in the oil for about 2 minutes. Do not brown them. Once the chips are slightly cooked, remove them from the oil and drain. Keep to one side.</li>
<br>
<li>Place the 2 tablespoons of flour reserved from the batter mix into a shallow bowl. Toss each fish fillet in the flour and shake off any excess.</li>
<br>
<li>Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.</li>
<br>
<li>Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully lower each fillet into the hot oil. Fry for approximately 8 minutes, or until the batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets from time to time with a large slotted spoon.</li>
<br>
<li>Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Cover with greaseproof paper (parchment paper) and keep hot.</li>
<br>
<li>Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips until golden and crisp, or about 5 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain. Season with salt.</li>
<br>
<li>Serve immediately with the hot fish accompanied by your favorite condiment.</li>
